  Changes in sharks:
  1) Added a separate object for every fish(aka star)
  2) Randomized y axis placement of fish(aka star)
  3) Removed gravity added upward and downaward movement
  4) Picking up fish gives points
  5) After all the fish on the screen are picked or colide with the left wall a new batch of fish spawn
  
  Things that need to be worked on:
    1)Updating sprites 
    2)Adding the garbage feature
    3)Adding a way to end the game
